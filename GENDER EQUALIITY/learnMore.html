    <h3>Gender Pay Gap Statistics</h3>
    <p>The global gender pay gap is not just a numberâ€”it's a complex issue that affects millions of women worldwide. In some countries, the gap is as large as 30%, while in others, it's smaller, but still significant. The gap is particularly noticeable in senior leadership positions where women earn, on average, 18% less than men in similar roles.</p>

    <h3>Why Does the Gender Pay Gap Exist?</h3>
    <p>Many factors contribute to the gender pay gap, including unconscious bias, gender roles, and career interruptions, such as taking time off to care for children. In addition, women often work in industries that are lower paid or are underrepresented in high-paying sectors like technology and finance.</p>

    <h3>Actions to Close the Gap</h3>
    <p>Several countries and organizations are taking active steps to close the gender pay gap. Initiatives like pay transparency, mandatory reporting, and gender audits are helping to bring attention to this disparity. Supporting these policies can drive real change.</p>

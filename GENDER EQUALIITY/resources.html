            <h2>RESOURCES</h2>
            <ul>
                <h3><li><strong>MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS</h3></strong>:Mentorship programs play a vital role in empowering women and fostering gender equality by providing guidance, support, and career advice. These programs connect experienced professionals with young women and girls, helping them build the skills and confidence they need to navigate their careers, make informed decisions, and overcome challenges. Many mentorship programs focus on specific sectors, such as technology, entrepreneurship, and politics, offering industry-specific insights and resources. By pairing mentees with role models, these programs help close the gender gap in leadership positions and ensure that women have the support they need to succeed in traditionally male-dominated fields. Moreover, mentorship programs help women build valuable networks, gain access to new opportunities, and increase their visibility within their industries. </li>
                <h3><li><strong>SCHOLARSHIPS FOR WOMEN</h3></strong>:Scholarships for women are essential tools for promoting gender equality in education and empowering women to achieve their academic and professional aspirations. These scholarships aim to reduce financial barriers and make higher education more accessible to women, particularly those from underrepresented or marginalized communities. They are available for a wide range of fields, including STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), healthcare, business, and the arts, with many targeted specifically at women pursuing degrees in male-dominated industries. By providing financial support, mentorship, and networking opportunities, these scholarships help women gain the skills and qualifications they need to excel in their careers and become leaders in their fields. They also contribute to addressing the gender disparities that exist in education and the workforce.</li>
                <h3><li><strong>HELPLINE AND SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS</h3></strong>:Helplines and support organizations are crucial resources for women facing various challenges, including domestic violence, mental health issues, harassment, and discrimination. These organizations provide confidential assistance, offering counseling, legal advice, and emergency services to women in crisis. They also connect women to shelters, job training programs, and educational resources to help them rebuild their lives and regain independence. Many helplines operate 24/7, ensuring that women can access support at any time, regardless of their situation. In addition, these organizations advocate for policy changes and work to raise awareness about gender-based violence and other critical issues affecting women. By providing immediate support and long-term solutions, helplines and support organizations play an essential role in protecting women's rights and promoting their safety and well-being.</li>

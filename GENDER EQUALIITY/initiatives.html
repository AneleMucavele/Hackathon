            <h2>Ongoing Initiatives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HeForShe</strong>: HeForShe is a global solidarity movement for gender equality, founded by UN Women, that encourages men and boys to be active participants in the fight for gender equality. This initiative aims to challenge gender biases and deeply rooted societal norms, especially in communities across Africa. HeForShe works with men in leadership positions, in various sectors such as business, government, and education, to advance gender equality. By advocating for the empowerment of women and girls, HeForShe fosters positive change and challenges the traditional barriers that prevent women from reaching their full potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Equal Pay for Equal Work</strong>: The Equal Pay for Equal Work movement is a global advocacy effort aimed at closing the gender pay gap. Despite substantial progress in many areas, women, especially women of color, continue to earn less than their male counterparts in virtually all industries. This initiative pushes for legislation, transparency in wage reporting, and employer accountability to ensure equal pay for equal work. It also addresses the systemic factors that contribute to the pay gap, including discrimination, lack of access to higher-paying roles, and gender-based job segregation. Advocates are working tirelessly to ensure that all women, regardless of their background or career path, receive fair compensation for their skills and contributions.</li>
                <li><strong>Safe Spaces</strong>: Safe Spaces is an initiative designed to create environments where women and marginalized groups can live, work, and interact without fear of violence, harassment, or discrimination. This initiative includes programs aimed at preventing domestic violence, workplace harassment, and gender-based violence in public spaces. Safe Spaces programs provide education, resources, and support services to empower women to take action in unsafe situations, while also working with local governments and law enforcement to ensure better protection and justice for victims. Additionally, Safe Spaces advocates for the creation of more inclusive and accessible spaces for women, both online and offline, to build a strong network of support and community.</li>

            <h2>Challenges in Achieving Gender Equality</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gender-Based Violence:</strong> Gender-based violence (GBV) is one of the most pervasive violations of human rights, affecting millions of women and girls globally each year. It encompasses a range of harmful behaviors, including domestic violence, sexual assault, female genital mutilation, trafficking, and early or forced marriage. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1 in 3 women worldwide experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, most often by an intimate partner. GBV not only causes severe physical and emotional harm to survivors but also contributes to long-term social and economic inequality, affecting women’s ability to access education, employment, and healthcare. Despite international efforts to address this issue, many women remain at risk due to inadequate legal protections, societal norms that tolerate violence, and a lack of support systems for victims.</li>
                <li><strong>Pay Gap:</strong> The gender pay gap continues to be a significant challenge to gender equality, with women earning less than men in nearly every country and across various industries. On average, women earn about 20% less than men globally, with some regions and sectors experiencing even larger disparities. Factors contributing to the pay gap include occupational segregation (where women are more likely to work in lower-paying sectors), gender-based discrimination, and unequal access to leadership positions. The gap is particularly wide for women of color and those in senior roles. Efforts to close the pay gap include advocating for pay transparency, implementing gender-responsive budgeting, and encouraging policies that promote equal opportunities for women in the workforce. Despite progress in some areas, the pay gap persists and remains a critical barrier to achieving true gender equality in the workplace.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Education:</strong> Education is a fundamental human right, yet millions of girls worldwide still face significant barriers to accessing quality education. In some regions, cultural norms, economic hardships, and gender stereotypes limit girls' opportunities to attend school, often leading to early marriages, child labor, or exclusion from educational institutions. According to UNESCO, 130 million girls worldwide are out of school, with many facing obstacles such as long distances to schools, lack of sanitary facilities, and gender-based violence in educational settings. Girls in conflict zones or rural areas are especially vulnerable. Educating girls is one of the most powerful tools for advancing gender equality, as it provides women with the skills and knowledge needed to enter the workforce, reduce poverty, and improve their overall well-being. However, continued efforts are needed to ensure that all girls, regardless of where they live, have access to education.</li>
                <li><strong>Sexual Harassment:</strong> Sexual harassment is a pervasive form of gender-based discrimination that affects women in various environments, including the workplace, public spaces, and online. It can range from unwanted comments and jokes to physical assault and stalking. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), nearly 1 in 3 women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual harassment at work. This behavior not only violates women’s rights but also creates an unsafe and hostile environment, affecting their mental health, career progression, and overall well-being. Sexual harassment is often underreported due to fear of retaliation, stigma, or lack of legal protection. Many women also face harassment in public spaces and on social media platforms, where online abuse and cyberbullying have become increasingly common. To combat sexual harassment, it is crucial to implement strong laws, create safe reporting mechanisms, and promote a culture of respect and equality in all areas of life.</li>
